2015.02.02 - version 1.1.1
 * WooCommerce 2.3 Compatibility
 * Tweak: Do not rely on wp_guess_url() when determining if the post is an OPC post
 * Tweak: Use the jQuery Visible plugin (https://github.com/customd/jquery-visible) instead of jQuery Viewport plugin for determining when an element is visible within the browser viewport.
 * Tweak: Prepend reponses/messages/notices within an '#opc-messages' div
 * Fix: Display custom product attributes on pricing table, notices and order review table the same way WooCommerce displays them - as uppercased words with spaces not dashes separating each word
 * Fix: Do not add two variations with the same attributes as two separate line items when the first was added via One Page Checkout and the second was added from a WooCommerce template
 * Fix: Remove/clear OPC related '.woocommerce-info' notices when an OPC post is 'updated' to avoid replication etc.

2014.12.17 - version 1.1
 * New: Improved support for numerous extensions including Name Your Price, Product Add Ons, Product Bundles, Composite Products
 * New: Cart management in OPC is now possible through a modified review-order template that includes Remove buttons and Quantity selectors identical to the ones used in the cart.php template. 
 * Tweak: Use add-to-cart button on single product template in addition to quantity selectors
 * Tweak: In the single-product template, add-to-cart buttons / quantity selectors are decoupled from cart item management, which allows us to re-use the core templates.
 * Tweak: Extensive variable/variations handling improvements. The OPC single product template now handles variations like the standard single product template
 * Tweak: Filter 'woocommerce_product_single_add_to_cart_text' only for OPC supported product types to rename "Add to cart" to "Add to order"
 * Tweak: In the table / list templates, the coupling between product-level quantity selectors and the cart has been maintained and enhanced to ensure that OPC page product quantity selectors target specific cart items that have been previously added from that container. 
 * Tweak: The functions that handle ajax requests have been modified to target cart item keys.
 * Tweak: For extension compatibility, cart item update requests that target specific cart keys do not remove + re-add cart items, to avoid deleting sensitive cart item data required by other extensions. Instead, cart item quantities are simply updated as usual.
 * Tweak: Unhook 'WC_Form_Handler::add_to_cart_action' from 'init' in OPC pages, to prevent products from being added to the cart when submitting an order
 * Tweak: More consistent use of 'wcopc_' prefix for actions/filters
 * Tweak: Only scroll to checkout form messages and notices when they are not already in the viewport
 * Tweak: If using a custom add-to-cart link, change the success message from WooCommerce's default "added to cart" to "added to order" and mention that order can be completed at the bottom of the page
 * Tweak: If using an add-to-cart link outside the OPC product selection fields, display the success or error notice at the top of the page, rather than the top of the checkout form (which may be further down the page)
 * Tweak: If using an add-to-cart link outside the OPC product selection fields, redirect the customer to a URL without the 'add-to-cart=ID' param to avoid adding the product to the cart when refreshing the page
 * Fix: WC 2.2.9 compatibility: add errors/messages after WooCommerce updates checkout, because it now removes all errors/messages when updating checkout

2014.11.17 - version 1.0.2
 * Fix: make sure cart cookies are set when adding items to cart to ensure checkout works for new guest customers

2014.11.10 - version 1.0.1
 * Tweak: include internationalisation files and load localisation file
 * Fix: strict notice

2014.10.24 - version 1.0
 * Initial release
